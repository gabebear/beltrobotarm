Community Robot Arm Ftobler Remix by 20sffactory - Belt Version

Derived from 20sffactory's firmware version of the robot arm which was originally designed by Ftobler at:<br>
  * https://github.com/20sffactory/robotarm<br>
  * https://github.com/ftobler/robotArm/<br>
  * https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1718984<br>
  * https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4415380<br>

### Major changes:
  * Adjustments of Gear Ratio to fit belts
  * Mechanical calibration endstops for all 3 axis
  
This firmware is still work-in-progress, and serves a good purpose to get the robot up and running with cartesian coordinates.
